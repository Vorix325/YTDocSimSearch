Project Name: YouTube Search Optimization

Date: September 2023 - December 2023
Description

This project aims to enhance the YouTube search functionality using advanced algorithms. The goal was to improve content discovery by optimizing search results for relevance and accuracy. A Flask backend was implemented to integrate the YouTube Data API, enabling retrieval and processing of video data. By utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, data manipulation, and TF-IDF vectorization, we improved the search accuracy and overall user experience.
Features

Integrated YouTube Data API for real-time video data.
Developed a query parser to refine search inputs.
Applied NLP techniques (tokenization, TF-IDF) to optimize search results.
Designed advanced search functions for enhanced content discovery.
Tested and validated the algorithm for relevance and accuracy.

Technologies Used

    Backend: Python (Flask)
    Libraries: scikit-learn, NLTK, pandas
    Frontend: HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap
    API Integration: YouTube Data API
    Version Control: Git

Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine: 
```
